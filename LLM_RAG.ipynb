The mention of \"Functional Requirements for Cognitive AI\" suggests that there is a detailed discussion or list of these requirements in the document, specifically on page 15, where the architecture and requirements are discussed. \\n\\nHowever, based on the context given and the nature of Cognitive AI as described, we can infer some potential functional requirements:\\n\\n1. **Programmatic Reasoning Capability**: The ability to go beyond probabilistic reasoning simulations to actual programmatic reasoning, implying a system that can engage with logic and structured decision-making processes in a manner that mimics human cognitive abilities.\\n\\n2. **Dual-layer Architecture**: This suggests that Cognitive AI systems must have a foundational structure that supports not just basic operations but also higher-order functions like reasoning, self-improvement, and adaptability.\\n\\n3. **Self-Improvement and Adaptability**: Systems must be capable of learning from their interactions and experiences to improve their performance over time without explicit reprogramming by humans.\\n\\n4. **Orchestration of Collective Cognition**: The ability to generate plans and workflows that guide the collective cognition and behavior of intelligent agents, and possibly human collaborators, towards achieving specific goals. This implies a requirement for managing and directing the efforts of multiple entities efficiently.\\n\\n5. **Structured Processes for Goal Achievement**: Cognitive AI systems should be able to channel interactions and reasoning through structured processes that guide entities towards goals, highlighting a need for a system capable of designing and implementing these processes.\\n\\nWithout the direct list from the document, these inferred requirements give a sense of what might be expected from a Cognitive AI system based on the paradigm shift from Conversational AI to Cognitive AI and the emphasis on higher-order intelligence capabilities.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 360, 'prompt_tokens': 477, 'total_tokens': 837, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-dddd555e-054d-45cc-b6eb-f57afd44e675-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 477, 'output_tokens': 360, 'total_tokens': 837})"
